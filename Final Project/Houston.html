            <h2>About the Gang</h2>
            <p>The Payday Gang are a set of robbers of various backgrounds who work together to steal money, gold, and other goods from various people. Their members include Dallas, Hoxton, Chains, Wolf, and Houston, all of which are lead by Bain their contractor. Throughout their time operating, they've robbed banks, other gangs, stores, and have done various other illegal activities. When they do rob, they typically run into security guards and police they have to go through to escape. They mainly operate through a network known as Crime.net, a series of criminals and contractors alike throughout Washington DC.</p>

            <p>We believe that this gangmember(sic) was using the alias of “Hoxton” until the break-out of James Hoxworth. Since then, according to security footage, he has adopted the alias “Houston”. He was present at the break-out of “Hoxton” and that, and subsequently acquired security footage, seems to hint at a level of animosity between the two men.

                Observations of “Houston” indicate that he may favor fulfilling the Ghost role. This could indicate training in infiltration and espionage, and may provide further leads to his identity.</p>
