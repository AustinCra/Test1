            <h2>About the Gang</h2>
            <p>The Payday Gang are a set of robbers of various backgrounds who work together to steal money, gold, and other goods from various people. Their members include Dallas, Hoxton, Chains, Wolf, and Houston, all of which are lead by Bain their contractor. Throughout their time operating, they've robbed banks, other gangs, stores, and have done various other illegal activities. When they do rob, they typically run into security guards and police they have to go through to escape. They mainly operate through a network known as Crime.net, a series of criminals and contractors alike throughout Washington DC.</p>

        <p>“Hoxton” was recently incarcerated at Hazelton Prison, but was freed by the Payday gang while he was being taken to a parole hearing. We are sure he will be very difficult to apprehend again.
           
            He has noticeably changed from his usual quiet demeanor and has begun to taunt and act brazenly towards law enforcement.
